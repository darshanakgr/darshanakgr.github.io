I am a 3rd year PhD student in School of Computing and Information Systems at Singapore Management University, working under the supervision of Professor Archan Misra. My research focuses on pervasive sensing with 3D point clouds. Prior to pursuing my Ph.D., I worked as a Research Engineer at the SMU-CMU Living Analytics Research Centre and as a Research Assistant at Singapore Management University. I received my BSc. Engineering in Computer Science & Engineering from University of Moratuwa, Sri Lanka in 2020.
